##CSS Positioning##

First, we have to use <div> to position anything.

Then,
In the style section,

position:relative;  
left:100px; / -100px ( - is used if you want to move it to the right)
top:100px; / - 100px (- is used if you want to move it to the bottom)
z- index:1;

z-index has been used if two boxes overlap each other. For example: 'A'boxes overlap 'B' box. 

But you want B box should overlap A box.

In that case, you can use z-index. Whichever box has large z-index value, that particular box will overlap other box.

In addition,

you can use opacity in order to see other box. Opacity value should be between 0 to 1.

REMEMBER:

There are 3 types of position value you can use:

1. position:relative;
2. position:absolute;
3. position:fixed;
